                <p>Hi, my name is Taylor Stallings, and I'm an aspiring web developer. I've had an interest in coding
                    ever since I had my own MySpace page circa 2005 - you'd really be surprised the amount of HTML a
                    middle schooler could learn by updating their MySpace profile page every other day - and I started
                    to realize I really liked coding when I took a few courses in college using JavaScript, R, and
                    Excel. Although I didn't major in computer science in college, I took enough classes to get a basic
                    understanding of the logic behind coding, and I knew it was something I was interested in. I'm
                    currently enrolled in the UNC Coding Bootcamp, which has been exciting thus far - I'm eager to learn
                    everything I can about coding, and hopefully I can land a job in a career I love after this.
                    Below I've provided links to a few projects I've worked on so far in the coding bootcamp course. I'm
                    only a few weeks into the course, but these samples demonstrate what I've learned so far, including
                    flexbox, responsive web design, and pseudo classes.</p>
